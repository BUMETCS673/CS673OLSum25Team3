<h1>John Gutierrez</h1>

I'm John Gutierrez, a motivated and passionate student pursuing a Master's degree in Software Development. I deeply value teamwork and lifelong learning, and I'm committed to making meaningful contributions to the team 3 project. Although I'm new to the tech industry, I'm excited to get into the field once I complete my degree. Through my coursework, I've gained exposure to several programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I've worked on a few small-scale projects so far, and I'm eager to expand my skills further. This class is particularly exciting because it introduces terminologies, tools, and technologies that are still new to me. While shifting toward technology, I have spent nearly 16 years in supply chain and inventory management. I currently live in New York City and look forward to what lies ahead in this school session.
